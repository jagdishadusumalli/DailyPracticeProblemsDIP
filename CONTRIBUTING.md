Use simple pull requests

Name the files by their date of assignment:

    Example: on 08/28/2019, name the files as dp08282019.py
    
Also, name the commits in the following format:

    Status: date(US), Company (where the interview question came from): Problem statement/name
    
    Example: for a question, solved by you on "Knapsack Problem" asked at an Apple interview, assigned on Aug 28, 2019, name the commit as
    Solution: 08/28/2019, Apple: Knapsack Problem
    
Looking for better/optimized solutions

P.S. I'm a total noob at GitHub and so may not follow standard documentation practices. I'll definitely improve over time
